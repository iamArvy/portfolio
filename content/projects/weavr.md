## ⚙️ Architecture & Design

Weavr is built using Nuxt’s file-based routing and component-driven architecture, with a strong emphasis on content separation. Project data and configuration are managed through Nuxt Content, allowing new projects or updates to be added without touching application logic.

The UI is composed using reusable Shadcn-Vue components styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and responsiveness. Animations are intentionally subtle to enhance user engagement without distracting from content.
