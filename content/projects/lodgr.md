## ⚙️ Architecture & Design

Lodgr is built using Nuxt's full-stack capabilities, combining server routes for API logic with a component-driven Vue 3 frontend. The API layer exposes structured endpoints for properties, leases, wishlists, and metadata such as locations and amenities. Mock data is used to simulate real database interactions, allowing the focus to remain on system design, data contracts, and frontend-backend integration.

The UI follows a clean, card-based layout system powered by Tailwind CSS and Shadcn-Vue components, ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and consistent visual hierarchy across the application.
