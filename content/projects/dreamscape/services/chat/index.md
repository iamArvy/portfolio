  description: The Chat Service is a real-time messaging microservice built with NestJS, supporting both GraphQL and REST API interfaces. It allows users to initiate private conversations or group chats, send messages, delete/update them, and retrieve conversation histories. The service integrates WebSocket (Socket.io) for live chat and uses Swagger and Apollo Playground for API documentation and testing.
