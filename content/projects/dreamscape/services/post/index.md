  title: Post Service,
  description: Post Service is a NestJS-based microservice built with Docker, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. It provides a REST API to create posts, comments, likes, retrieve posts, get user posts, and delete posts. Posts and comments share the same model, with comments referencing their parent post via a parent_id. GraphQL and SQS support are planned for future releases, supporting an event-driven architecture.
